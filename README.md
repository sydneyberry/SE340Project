# SE340Project
Our project topic was client-server architecture and we decided to do the optional implementation. For our implementation, we made a simple webpage and placed it on a server on a raspberry pi. This will be used to demonstrate how multiple clients can access the same resources at the same time. 

In our presentation, we will discuss a more in depth planned system that we could apply this architecture to.
